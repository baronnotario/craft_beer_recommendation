Nose is like citrus rinds and concentrated orange as well. Flavor is intense orange, almost like the flavor of Tang. A bit too much IMO. Feel has a fuller carbonation. Liquid is about right. This beer just doesn't work for me. Way too much tang and unbalanced.\\t\\t\"\n",

Taste was also fantastic, very nice roasty character with oatmeal creaminess and chewiness making an obvious presence. Very full mouthfeel, and on the sweeter side of an imperial stout, which I tend to like. I got a big marshmallow like character in the taste as well and overall this was an amazing beer.

Taste is dark roast, and a noticeable amount of acidity and light tartness giving it a uniqueness from other Imperial Stouts. A bit of a prickly carbonated mouthfeel at first, which subsides later. Slightly thick mouthfeel, with a dry dark chocolate finish. Just a hint warming. Ever so slightly tart, dark chocolate flavor as it warms.

       "1546815  \" Bottle courtesy of DrBayern - Rich thick nicely viscous black pour in a snifter with a short lived brown head. Smell is of some dark roasted malt, but the big hoppiness of this came off as extremely metallic to me. As it warmed this lessened, and it was more roasty with a sharp hoppiness. Taste was fairly hopped, dark and roasty with very little sweetness, and with alcohol only lightly noticeable, but pleasant. A mild tasting finish with a good bitterness and a nicely thick pleasant mouthfeel. As far as stouts go, I'm starting to think I enjoy the sweeter and/or less hoppy stouts, because to me the dark roast character and the big hoppiness seem to clash. Rather than the citrusy, light, aromatic floral qualities as present in Pales, IPAs, etc.. I rather find the hops tasting bland bitter and metallic if predominant in bigger stouts. Not bad at all, but just not my speed. \\t\\tRe-rate - enjoyed on draght and really liked the dry roastiness to it. Solid mouthfeel and body and an enj...\n",

Flavor is coffee up front and roasted malt, but very thin. Thin malt flavor, roastiness and body, despite the strong coffee flavor. Not great, but drinkable.\\t\\t\"\n",

Taste is fruity, caramelly smooth maltiness, and nice citrusy hop flavor and a solid, but mildish bitterness that works great for a pale ale.
